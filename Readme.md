Here’s a more detailed guide with additional considerations and configurations for using Nginx to serve a static website. We'll expand on scenarios like HTTPS, environment-specific configurations, and multi-stage Docker builds.

This Dockerfile includes custom configuration, optimizations, and considerations for environment variables.
Save the file as index.html in your project directory (e.g., under dist/).
If you're using the provided Docker setup, this file will be served when you build and run the container.
Here’s an example of a simple script.js file that adds interactivity to your static website. This script demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and a dynamic greeting message.

Here’s a complete and optimized Dockerfile for serving a static website with Nginx. This file is simple to use, includes best practices, and can handle most static website scenarios.

Build the Docker Image Run the following command to build your Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t static-website .
Run the Docker Container Start the container and map it to a local port (e.g., 8080):

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:80 static-website
Kubernetes Deployment File
If you want to deploy the static website on Kubernetes, you'll need a deployment.yaml file to describe how the pods should run.

deployment.yaml
Steps to Use the Kubernetes Deployment
Replace <your-docker-image> with the Docker image name you built (e.g., static-website:latest).
Run the following command to apply the deployment:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Check the status of your pods:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
To access the service, use the external IP provided by Kubernetes (if using LoadBalancer) or port-forward the service:
bash
Copy code
kubectl port-forward service/static-website-service 8080:80
Steps to Use the Terraform File
Initialize Terraform:

Initialize Terraform to download the necessary provider plugins:
bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan the Deployment:

Run terraform plan to see the actions Terraform will perform:
bash
Copy code
Once the resources are created, Terraform will output the EKS cluster name and endpoint. Use this information to configure kubectl to interact with your new EKS cluster:
bash
Copy code
aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name my-eks-cluster

The provider.tf file in Terraform is used to configure the provider, in this case, AWS. This file defines how Terraform will authenticate with AWS and which AWS region to interact with. Here's an example of how you can set up the provider.tf file for AWS.
region: This specifies the AWS region where you want to create resources. Update it to the region of your choice (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1).

access_key and secret_key: These fields specify your AWS access credentials. It is recommended to not hard-code your credentials directly in the provider.tf file. Instead, use environment variables or a variables.tf file to keep them secure. You can also use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials, which Terraform will use by default.

Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI (aws configure) to set up credentials, and Terraform will automatically pick up those credentials without specifying them explicitly.
version: This specifies the version of the AWS provider you want to use. Using ~> 4.0 means Terraform will use the latest version that is compatible with 4.x.

The provider.tf file in Terraform is used to configure the provider, in this case, AWS. This file defines how Terraform will authenticate with AWS and which AWS region to interact with. Here's an example of how you can set up the provider.tf file for AWS.

provider.tf
hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-west-2"  # Specify the AWS region where you want to create resources
  access_key = var.aws_access_key  # Use a variable for the AWS access key (optional if using environment variables)
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key  # Use a variable for the AWS secret key (optional if using environment variables)
  version = "~> 4.0"  # Optional: Specify the AWS provider version
}
Explanation of the Fields:
region: This specifies the AWS region where you want to create resources. Update it to the region of your choice (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1).

access_key and secret_key: These fields specify your AWS access credentials. It is recommended to not hard-code your credentials directly in the provider.tf file. Instead, use environment variables or a variables.tf file to keep them secure. You can also use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials, which Terraform will use by default.

Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI (aws configure) to set up credentials, and Terraform will automatically pick up those credentials without specifying them explicitly.
version: This specifies the version of the AWS provider you want to use. Using ~> 4.0 means Terraform will use the latest version that is compatible with 4.x.

Using Environment Variables (Recommended)
Instead of storing AWS credentials in the provider.tf file, you can set them as environment variables for better security.

bash
Copy code
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
Using variables.tf (For Credentials)
You can create a variables.tf file to manage AWS credentials using variables instead of hardcoding them in provider.tf. Here is how:

variables.tf
hcl
Copy code
variable "aws_access_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS access key ID"
}

variable "aws_secret_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS secret access key"
}

Now, in your provider.tf, you can reference these variables:

hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key
}
To supply the variables when running Terraform, you can use a terraform.tfvars file or set them via the command line:

terraform.tfvars
hcl
Copy code
aws_access_key = "your-access-key-id"
aws_secret_key = "your-secret-access-key"
Authenticating with AWS Using IAM Roles (Best Practice)
If you're running Terraform on an EC2 instance, you can use IAM roles to authenticate, avoiding the need to store access keys. Make sure the EC2 instance has the necessary IAM role attached with appropriate permissions to create resources on AWS.

In this case, you can simplify the provider configuration:
Install Prometheus
SSH into your EC2 instance where you want to install Prometheus.

Download Prometheus: Download the latest Prometheus release for your system.

bash
Copy code
Install Grafana:

On an EC2 instance (or another server), follow the instructions to install Grafana from the official website.

Add Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana:

Open Grafana in your browser (typically http://<grafana-ip>:3000).
Login using the default credentials (admin/admin).
Go to Configuration > Data Sources.
Add Prometheus and set the URL to your Prometheus instance (http://<prometheus-ip>:9090).
Create Dashboards:

After adding Prometheus as a data source, you can create custom dashboards or import pre-built ones (Grafana has many pre-built Prometheus dashboards).
Step 6: Set Up Alerts (Optional)
Prometheus also supports alerting. You can define alerting rules in the prometheus.yml file or in separate files.

Example of a Basic Alert in prometheus.yml:
